# Want me to give this talk at your institution?

I'm happy to travel to your instituion to give a version of this talk. All I ask for is travel expenses and the opportunity to talk to scientists and/or software/hardware geeks about Research Software Engineering before or afterwards. Please [contact me](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?page_id=2055) to discuss this.
